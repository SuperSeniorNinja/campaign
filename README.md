<h1>PHP/Laravel Email/Sms campaign project</h1>
<h5>
Send bulk emails and text messages by using Sendgrid/twilio API integration.
User uplaods over 100k audience data by CSV. It uploads csv and extracts emails and phones and names and save them in DB.
Once user uploads audience data, user is lead to email/sms template page and here he can edit his email/sms template and add his contents and promotional media resources about their business and survey and votes.
User is able to launch the campaign by clicking "Send all" or "P2P" buttons.
I have introduced the way of emails being placed in SPAM folder.
If they reply to emails/text messages, we get their response and attach them to original usernames and emails/text messages.
Adminsitrator can monitor all survey/vote results in a csv file and gives permission to the certain user.
User can get access to those RESULT csv only by admin permission.
Administrator is able to manage all accounts, reports, email/sms templates.
